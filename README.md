# Contact Manager

This is a demo app of a react/redux client application interacting with a backend API.

Entities representing contacts can be added, deleted, and modified using the standard CRUD methods. The client-side representation waits to receive confirmation from the server before re-rendering, and displays loading indicators. The state is persisted in local storage.

It is possible to change the simulated delay in the settings view.
